            "overview": "<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic region is a busy corridor for commercial and recreational ship traffic and is home to the world\u2019s largest naval base, as well as many other military installations and training grounds. The U.S. Coast Guard works with other agencies to ensure that navigation routes for both commercial and defense vessels are accessible and safe. Their security focus is on the safety of ports, vessels, and facilities, both on and away from shore and their presence is notable throughout the region, with bases in Norfolk, Baltimore, Cape May, and Staten Island.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Naval Station at Norfolk, Virginia supports 75 large ships and 130 aircraft on seven miles of piers and wharfs, and it houses the largest concentration of Navy personnel in the country. Every year, its Port Services branch oversees more than 3,000 maneuvers as ships arrive and depart their berths. Spatial planners and resource managers must account for this intensive activity and work with military leaders to ensure their missions are not compromised as planning decisions are made. \r\n<p>\r\nThe legal framework supporting maritime security in the U.S. is based on five principal laws:\r\n<ul><li>Espionage Act (1917) \u2013 enabled the Coast Guard to make regulations to prevent losses to harbors and vessels during national emergencies.\r\n</li><li>Magnusson Act (1950) \u2013 provided permanent port security regulations and allowance to control movement of foreign vessels in U.S. ports.\r\n</li><li>Ports and Waterways Safety Act (1972) \u2013 allowed additional protection for port facilities and improved efforts to avoid degrading the marine environment.\r\n</li><li>Maritime Transportation Security Act (2002) \u2013 provided broad authority to prevent acts of terrorism within U.S. waters. \r\n</li><li>International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (2002) \u2013 amendments to International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea to enhance maritime security.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>\r\nData under development for the Security theme will include areas with potential hazards or public use restrictions and other information deemed to be critical for spatial planning. To ensure that security interests are fully considered, regional ocean planning leads will include defense representatives and officials responsible for maintaining the security of our vessels, ports and Nation.\r\n",

Its estuaries, salt marshes, sea grasses, barrier islands, cold water corals, and submarine canyons provide spawning, nursery, and forage habitats that support diverse resident and migratory marine life including invertebrates, seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals.  ",
            "overview": "<p>\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic is well known for nutrient-rich and highly productive waters. The region is a transitional area between the rocky shores of New England and the gently sloping South Atlantic, and it is influenced by two large estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. As a result, the Mid-Atlantic region  is home to a wealth of complex ecosystems and its estuaries, salt marshes, sea grasses, barrier islands, cold water corals, and submarine canyons provide spawning, nursery, and forage habitats that support diverse resident and migratory marine life including invertebrates, seabirds, fishes, and marine mammals. \r\n<p>\r\nThe topography is mostly flat, but features sandy shoals and swales, sand wedges and waves, and a broad continental shelf embedded cold water coral patch habitats and incised by submarine canyons along the shelf-slope break. These areas support biologically diverse and abundant benthic (seafloor) macrofauna, demersal fish, and foraging concentrations of sea birds, sea ducks, and bottlenose dolphins. Benthic habitats contain over 2000 species of invertebrates such as marine worms, sponges, shrimp, crab, clams, scallops, snails, sea stars, and anemones. Another invertebrate--corals--establish reefs that are known to be habitat for black seabass and tautog though research on the locations and extents of these ecologically important patchy habitats is scant.\r\n<p>\r\nDemersal fish (or groundfish) are characterized by their close association with the seafloor for feeding, spawning, and juvenile nursery areas. The Mid-Atlantic region is particularly productive for demersal fish with some such as summer flounder and black seabass supporting major historic and current recreational and commercial fisheries. \r\n<p>\r\nDiadromous fish use both freshwater and marine habitats during their life cycle and these species have great cultural and ecological significance in the Mid-Atlantic region. The diadromous fish of the region\u2014striped bass, alewife, American eel, American Shad, Atlantic salmon, Atlantic sturgeon, Atlantic tomcod, blueback herring, hickory shad, rainbow smelt, sea-run brook trout, and shortnose sturgeon--provide an important energy link between freshwater, estuarine, and marine food webs and many of these species are found only in the Northwest Atlantic ocean.\r\n<p>\r\nLarge pelagic fish are migratory are typically found well above the seafloor in the water column. Pelagic species play a key ecological role as predators that regulate their prey communities and structure marine food webs. Some inhabit the region only seasonally and many of the details of their life history are not known. A selection of important species includes albacore tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna, blue marlin, swordfish, great hammerhead shark, sand tiger shark, sandbar shark. The wide ranging distribution of these species across diverse habitat types, their roles as apex predators, and their threatened population status make them ripe for inclusion in regional spatial and conservation plans.\r\n<p>\r\nMarine mammals are large migratory species that use this region primarily in spring and summer when food is abundant. Due to their seasonal abundance and charismatic nature, marine mammals have a long-standing, complex relationship with humans in this region. Ten species, among them bottlenose dolphin, fin whale, harbor porpoise, humpback whale, North Atlantic right whale, and sperm whale are important cultural and biodiversity icons of the region.\r\n<p>\r\nSea turtles use both oceanic (inner shelf region and offshore) and terrestrial (beach) ecosystems. Their highly migratory and long life history characteristics present unique challenges to their continued protection and recovery. Sea turtles may have once comprised an important component of the region\u2019s coastal food webs, consuming prey including fish, invertebrates, and sea grasses. Three species of sea turtle (green, leatherback and loggerhead) are present in the Mid-Atlantic.\r\n<p>\r\nThe varied habitats and abundant resources of the Mid-Atlantic support a highly diverse group of coastal and marine birds that depend on both the oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems of the region throughout the year.  Millions of birds pass through the region, which is located along the globally significant migration corridor of the Atlantic Flyway, while traveling between breeding and wintering grounds that span the entire Western Hemisphere.  Species of high conservation concern, like the Red Knot and Whimbrel depend on high quality coastal habitats for critical stopover areas.  Pelagic species, like the Northern Gannet and Audubon\u2019s Shearwater, use  open water habitats during both migration and wintering seasons.  Shorebirds, waterbirds and waterfowl, such as the Piping Plover, American Oystercatcher, Least Terns, Black Duck and Brant breed or feed along shorelines in the region and can be heavily impacted by increasing human pressure to these coastal systems.  Many of the species occurring in the Mid-Atlantic rank as species of high conservation concern.\r\n<p>\r\nTidal flows, complex seasonal temperature and circulation patterns, and varied seafloor topography combine to create both persistent and shifting habitats that serve as critical resources tracked by Mid-Atlantic marine species, and give rise to upwellings that fuel plankton blooms and key forage species such as menhaden, squid and butterfish.  Millions of seabirds, invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals, and large pelagic fishes such as tunas and marlins use diverse Mid-Atlantic habitat and forage resources in specific ways.  Cross shelf (east-west) migrants like summer flounder and black seabass and north-south migrants like striped bass, menhaden, and large whales all traverse the region twice a year as they move from southern and near shore locations in winter to offshore or northern locations in summer.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal has compiled habitat data, as well as known distributions and abundances of many of the key fish, mammal, bird, and reptile species found in the Mid-Atlantic region. In the future, additional data will be added to round out the collection and to allow regional planners to make management and policy decisions that are compatible with and enhance the conservation of these animals and their ecosystem.",

            "overview": "<p>\r\nOffshore wind has the potential to be a key domestic renewable energy source, especially for the major cities and large population centers along the East coast of the U.S. The Mid-Atlantic\u2019s offshore wind resources have the potential to produce close to 200 gigawatts of energy every year, enough to power 40 million U.S. homes. Someday, the region\u2019s ocean wave energy could generate an additional 50,000 gigawatts of power and contribute even more significantly to the U.S. energy supply. These renewable energy sources could help meet growing electricity demands in the region and help to reduce carbon emissions. \r\n<p>\r\nProduction of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and ocean waves, may be less damaging to the environment than production through burning of fossil fuels, like oil, natural gas, and coal because renewable energy facilities produce much lower emissions of greenhouse gasses and other harmful pollutants such as arsenic, lead and mercury.  Additionally, renewable energy production may be more cost effective and efficient than traditional methods because once infrastructure is built, the amount of energy produced is quite stable for the remainder of that system\u2019s lifespan. While the inputs (wind and waves) may fluctuate daily or seasonally they should remain consistent over longer time scales, allowing producers and consumers to rely on steady energy levels.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe Department of the Interior has identified Wind Planning Areas (WPA)--locations that may be suitable for wind development--along the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s outer shelf. Data are being collected inside and outside these high priority areas so regulators and stakeholders can make informed and responsible judgments when issuing permits and making siting and investment decisions. Annual average wind speeds are an indication of the potential available energy at a location. Here, wind speeds modeled from limited observations by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and AWS Truepower are expressed at a height of 90 meters above the ocean surface where wind turbine hubs are likely to be located. \r\n<p>\r\nNot all the wind and waves that exist offshore are available for harvest however, and all potential energy estimates should be constrained to account for various environmental and socioeconomic factors that may exist in an area. Some of these constraints include potential overlapping use conflicts with shipping lanes, marine mammal, bird, and bat migration pathways, and traditional areas for fishing and recreational use. Infrastructure may need to be built far enough from shore to address concerns over impacts to scenic views, but close enough that the cost of bringing the electricity to shore is not prohibitive. All of these issues should be accounted for in regional ocean planning and the MARCO Ocean Data Portal provides key information that will help to raise awareness of the potential for renewable energy and support decision maker\u2019s efforts to manage resources effectively and minimize conflicts.\r\n",

            "overview": "<p>\r\nMid-Atlantic maritime industries include shipping, transport, tourism, dredging, offshore sand mining, and some of the nation\u2019s busiest ports at New York-New Jersey, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, and Norfolk. These ports are crucial links in the nation\u2019s transportation system, constitute a key element of the economy, employ many thousands of people, and have the potential to serve as environmental stewards of our region\u2019s harbors and surrounds.\r\n<p>\r\nThe U.S. seaport network unloads $3.8 billion in goods each day and Mid-Atlantic ports are a huge contributor, maintaining several national distinctions. The country\u2019s top port for fruits and juices is Wilmington; the fourth busiest tanker port is Philadelphia; products that go through Baltimore\u2019s ports reach over a third of the country within a day and anything entering the U.S. on wheels--from cars to giant tractors--alight in Baltimore, making it the nation\u2019s top Ro-Ro (roll on-roll off) port. The world\u2019s largest natural deep water harbor is at Hampton Roads and it stays ice-free throughout the year, making it suitable for a conglomeration of military facilities, coal piers, shipyards, and miles of waterfront property and beaches which add to the diversity and stability of our nation. The region supports important points of departure for the nation\u2019s cruise ship industry and, in 2011, close to one million people vacationed on ocean cruises originating in New York and Baltimore.\r\n<p>\r\nThe MARCO Ocean Data Portal contains Automatic Identification System (AIS) information from 2009, processed to focus on highly travelled shipping routes near port entrances. AIS data are collected by the U.S. Coast Guard using automated two-way radio transmissions that track real-time vessel information such as ship identity, purpose, course, and speed, primarily in coastal waters. AIS is required on all passenger vessels and vessels with gross tonnage greater than 300, so smaller vessel traffic is not represented in the database. MARCO is currently consulting with the Coast Guard and shipping industry stakeholders to evaluate how well these data indicate total ship traffic density and what additional data may be needed to fully represent shipping activity.\r\n<p>\r\nThe viability, safety, and growth needs of the commercial shipping industry need to be addressed in regional ocean planning. Accordingly, MARCO will consult with major port and navigation stakeholders to evaluate what additional map data may be needed to inform regional ocean planning decisions and help ensure stakeholder interests are well represented.\r\n",

The combination of these variables and their association to each other furnish a broad overview of regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this data layer is to allow the user to view both the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) and the data from which the CVI is calculated (tides, wave height, relative sea-level rise, coastal slope, geomorphology, and shoreline erosion and accretion rate) for the U.S. Atlantic Coast.

Wind speed data for all of the MARCO states was created as part of onshore wind mapping projects. Speed data was extrapolated to 50 nautical miles offshore by NREL. The 90 m wind speed was calculated by a linear interpolation between 70 m and 100 m wind speeds. A horizontal discontinuity (seam) in the wind resource is present at the border of New York and New Jersey. Discontinuities in the data result from offshore data that is based on different versions of the numerical model used for the different onshore mapping projects and the way the extrapolation software interprets the data on either side of the seam.
